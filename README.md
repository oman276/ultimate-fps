# ultimate-fps
A game developed by me for the Unexpected Jam (September 12, 2020)

~~~~

This game was created over a period of just over 2 weeks (August 29 - September 12, 2020) for the 
Unexpected Jam, using C# and Unity.

The theme for this Jam was "Unexpected", which I interpreted to mean twisting genre conventions to 
create unexpected experiences for the player. To that end, I decided to twist what an FPS game could be.
Traditionally, FPS means First Person Shooter. When the player sees the title Ultimate FPS, they assume
it's a shooter game without even thinking about it. I surprise the player by making each different level
a different genre of "FPS"- from First Person Snowmobiling, to First Person Steak-Off, to First Person
Speakerphone, and more. I tie this all together with a cheesy spy-thriller story voiced by me and my 
friends.

This is by far my most ambitious game ever, and my first ever 3D game. Not only did I have a whole new
dimension to consider when coding and designing, I had to create 3D assets to satisfy 6 different styles 
of gameplay. These 3D assets were mostly made by putting the basic geometric shapes together, as I really
didn't have the time to learn 3D modelling on top of all the other work I had to do. Each individual
game had to be optimized and tested to ensure the core gameplay loop was as fun as possible.

The hardest thing to code was the dialogue system. I had apparently not learned my lesson from Main Street
VCR Repair, and created a script with over 80 individual lines of dialogue. Not only did each line require 
it's own audio clip to be created and imported, but each line needed a defined length, a defined transcription
for the subtitles I had decided to add, as well as needing to be triggered at the right places in the narrative
for the story to play out. It was the singular most time consuming part of the project, but it ended up working
just like it needed to.

There were 180 total submissions to the jam. I scored in the top 37% of submissions with exceptional scores
in Gameplay Innovation (top 27%) and Unexpectedness (top 16%). All art and code was created by me. The dialogue
was recorded by me and my friends, who all voiced different characters.
