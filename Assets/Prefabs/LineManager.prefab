  clipText:
  - Agent! Are you Okay? We lost you in the storm.
  - "I\u2019m okay. How far to Evilbad HQ?"
  - About a hundred meters. Talk to you when you get there.
  - "You\u2019re here. Remember: Act Evil."
  - "Ah, our final guest. You must be\u2026"
  - "Not a Secret Agent, that\u2019s for sure."
  - Of course! Only treasured members of the Evilbad Family have this address-
  - Out of my way, imbecile!
  - "You\u2019re supposed to be Fredrick Evilbad? My beloved nephew?"
  - I sure am!
  - "Hmm. You know, I did so many crimes with Fredrick. I stole sharks from the natural
    history museum with him. I blew up the Eiffel Tower with him. You\u2019re wearing
    his favorite blue sweater vest but\u2026 hmm."
  - Boss?
  - "You know, the one thing that Fredrick was good at- was cooking a great steak.
    If you\u2019re the real Fredrick, you\u2019ll be able to do it just like I remember
    it."
  - "Agent? What\u2019s happening? Why are your sensors picking up seasoning?"
  - "The family has me grilling, to prove I\u2019m really who I say I am."
  - "But you can\u2019t cook!"
  - I know.
  - Just try to cook each side of the steak for roughly the same length of time. Roughly.
  - "Not gonna lie, that was a really great steak. You have Fredrick\u2019s skill
    with a skillet."
  - "That\u2019s because I\u2019m the real Frederick."
  - Hmm.
  - "Uh oh. Boss, it\u2019s Auntie."
  - "Uh oh indeed. We didn\u2019t invite her to the party. You were always great at
    calming her down, Frederick. Pick up the phone."
  - "Hello dears! Just calling to make sure there are people in the house. The lights
    are on, but I never got an invite to any party. Ha! Well, it\u2019s good to know
    that I won\u2019t be wasting any of these stolen nukes by firing them at the house!"
  - Auntie! Calm down!
  - Calm down? CALM DOWN? HOW ABOUT YOUR ASHES CALM DOWN!
  - It was an honest misunderstanding! You know how Uncle Evilbad gets forgetful sometimes!
  - "Oh please. I\u2019ve heard that excuse before."
  - "Remember the time he \u201Cforgot\u201D to invite me to the joint bank/McDonald\u2019s
    robbery? Or the Great Penguin Swap of \u201882?"
  - "The Great\u2026 what?"
  - "The Great Penguin Swap of \u201882! How could you forget? It was my magnum opus
    and you just forgot about it? That\u2019s it."
  - Oh, the Great Penguin Swap! I remember the Penguin Swap!
  - Right? And Frank never invited me to it! To my own evil plan!
  - "Honestly. I put so much into this family and this is how I\u2019m treated?"
  - Is it maybe because you keep threatening to nuke us?
  - Oh yeah! The nukes! Thanks for reminding me!
  - "We value you! We really do! We\u2019ve been talking about how we miss you!"
  - "\u2026 Really? You\u2019ve been talking about me!"
  - "What uh\u2026 what have you been talking about?"
  - The time you blew up the Eiffel Tower!
  - "The WHAT? I wasn\u2019t even there for that!"
  - "The famous joint Bank/McDonald\u2019s Robbery!"
  - Wow! See, I knew that was one for the history books!
  - "You know what, it would honestly be a waste of these nukes to blow you guys up.
    There\u2019s dozens of secret BKA bases I found the location of, I\u2019ll blow
    those up instead."
  - Uh, Okay! Great plan, Auntie!
  - Thanks! See you next year!
  - "Well, we aren\u2019t all dead, so thanks for that. I think you\u2019ve proven
    yourself a worthy member of the Evilbad family, Frederick."
  - Uh, thank you, Uncle.
  - "I think it\u2019s time we get to work. As the world\u2019s most evil family,
    it\u2019s time we get our beloved nephew reacquainted with the family business."
  - Keep him going. This is going to sound GREAT at the court hearing.
  - Evil stuff, huh? What kind of evil stuff?
  - "Well, we do all kinds of evil stuff, but the core of the family business\u2026
    it\u2019s depraved. It\u2019s ruthless. It\u2019s indisputably evil."
  - Movie Piracy.
  - Movie Piracy? Really?
  - "Hey, what\u2019s more evil than this? Nothing. That\u2019s what. And now you\u2019re
    gonna help us out. We got a quota of 3 movies downloaded every 20 seconds. But
    make sure not to click on any of the virus downloaders- or we\u2019ll kick ya
    back out into the cold!"
  - "Alright everybody! We\u2019ve got 20 seconds of work in, now it\u2019s time for
    our mandatory 15 minute break."
  - "They\u2019re all leaving to have lunch. Now\u2019s the time to try and take out
    the Boss. Just let me hack into the security system to disable it\u2026"
  - "Uh oh? What\u2019s uh oh?"
  - WHAT DID YOU DO?
  - "MY FINGERS SLIPPED AND I ACCIDENTALLY PRESSED THE \u201CSELF-DESTRUCT\u201D BUTTON
    INSTEAD OF THE \u201CDISABLE BUTTON\u201D!"
  - SELF-DESTRUCT?
  - "IT\u2019S OK, IT\u2019S OK, IT\u2019S OK, UMMM- SEE THOSE 4 EXPOSED WIRE BOXES
    ON THE WALL? I NEED YOU TO SNIP ONE EACH, IN THIS ORDER: RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE."
  - RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE. GOT IT.
  - OH, AND YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS.
  - WHAT?
  - NO TIME FOR TALK! GO!
  - "Okay, I did it. I\u2019m not dead."
  - "Great job! Sorry about the scare. On the bright side, the HQ is in chaos right
    now, and all the security is disabled. Now\u2019s the time to go after the Boss-
    and end this once and for all. "
  - "Great job! Sorry about the scare. On the bright side, the HQ is in chaos right
    now, and all the security is disabled. Now\u2019s the time to go after the Boss-
    and end this once and for all. "
  - What the-
  - 'Oh, hey Agent! Thanks for coming to help, but no need. I already got this guy
    cuffed and tranquilized. '
  - "You were a double agent this whole time? You aren\u2019t a BKA Agent, who are
    you?"
  - "I\u2019m with Interpol! "
  - "Interpol\u2026"
  - "We\u2019ve been tracking this guy for a while, looks like we just got here first.
    I have to say, though, you were a terrible Fredrick. I mean, you don\u2019t even
    look like him. I knew right away."
  - "Sorry you didn\u2019t get the big win Agent, but- one more thing? Before you
    leave?"
  - Hmm?
  - "Can you grab me that steak you were making earlier? I haven\u2019t eaten anything
    today, and it looked really good."
  - Alright.
  - Thank you, Agent. That will be all.
  - '... uh oh.'
